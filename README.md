**Develop & deploy serverless applications on remote GPUs.**

[Kuda](https://kuda.dev) helps prototyping and deploying serverless applications that need GPUs and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io).

It is based on [Knative](https://knative.dev), [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev) and [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), and supports the major cloud providers.

## Disclaimer

ðŸ§ª This is a **very early** and **experimental** work in progress:

- Most things won't work out of the box.
- It might break things in the cluster. Keep it away from production resources :)

## Key Features

**Serverless GPU applications**

- Kuda uses [Knative](https://knative.dev) to consume GPUs only when there is traffic, and scales down to zero when there's no traffic.

**Easy to use**

- `kuda setup <provider>` : Setup a new cluster will all the requirements on the provider's managed Kubernetes, or upgrade an existing cluster.
- `kuda app dev` : Deploys an application and watches your local folder so that the app reloads automatically on the cluster when you make local changes.
- `kuda app deploy` : Deploy the application as a serverless container.

**Language/Framework agnostic**

- Built and deployed with [Docker](https://docker.io), applications can be written in any language and use any framework.
- Applications deployed with Kuda are not required to import any specific library.

**Cloud provider Compatibility**

| Provider | Status                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| GCP      | [In progress...](providers/gcp) |
| AWS      | [In progress...](providers/aws) |
| Azure    | Not started                     |
| NGC      | Not started                     |
