**Develop, deploy and manage serverless APIs on remote GPUs.**

[Kuda](https://kuda.dev) helps prototyping, deploying and managing serverless APIs that need GPUs and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).

It is based on [Knative](https://knative.dev) and [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev).

## Disclaimer

ðŸ§ª This is a **very early** and **experimental** work in progress:

- Most things won't work out of the box.
- It might break things in the cluster. Keep it away from production resources :)
