ðŸ§ª **Status:** early and experimental WIP

## Rapidly develop and deploy serverless APIs that need GPUs

Kuda deploys APIs as serverless containers using [Knative](https://knative.dev)
which means you can use any language and any framework.
All you need is a Dockerfile.

## A simple interface for the full serverless API development cycle

- `kuda dev` Deploy the API on remote GPUs in dev mode (with file sync & live reload)
- `kuda deploy` Deploy the API in production mode.
  It will be automatically scaled down to zero when there is no traffic,
  and back up when there are new requests.

## Intuitive configuration with full control

Each API is configured with a simple declarative manifest such as:

```yaml
kudaManifestVersion: v1alpha1

# Name of the API.
name: hello-gpu

# 'deploy' is the configuration used when running `kuda deploy`.
# It has sensible defaults but you can override all the properties.
deploy:
  dockerfile: ./Dockerfile

# 'dev' is the configuration used when running `kuda dev`.
# It inherits all properties from 'deploy' which you can override individually.
dev:
  # Use python3 to start the Flask debug server rather than gunicorn.
  entrypoint:
    command: python3
    args: ["main.py"]
  # Live sync all python files.
  sync:
    - "**/*.py"
  # Set FLASK_ENV to "development" to enable Flask debugger & live reload.
  env:
    - name: FLASK_ENV
      value: development
```
